Hey developers,

Welcome to the React documentation. In this documentation, you will learn how to use React to build web applications.

I am [Muhammad Rizwan Ashiq](https://www.github.com/mrizwanashiq). I am a software engineer and a MERN stack developer. I am currently working as a software engineer at [MercurySols](https://www.mercurysols.org/). 

In this series of docs, I will write about the MERN stack and how to use it to build a React.js application. So, I hope you will enjoy this series of docs. I will try to keep this up-to-date. And I will also write code example and explanation for each blog, and provide the GitHub link for each blog.

So, let's start with the first blog.
