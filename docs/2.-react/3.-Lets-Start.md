## React Render HTML
Reacts goal is in many ways to render HTML in a web page.

React renders HTML to the web page by using a function called `ReactDOM.render()`.

## The Render Function
The `ReactDOM.render()` function takes two arguments, HTML code and an HTML element.

```js
ReactDOM.render(
    <h1>Hello World</h1>,
    document.getElementById('root')
);
```

The purpose of the function is to display the specified HTML code inside the specified HTML element.

But render where?

There is another folder in the root directory of your React project, named "public". In this folder, there is an index.html file.

You'll notice a single `<div>` in the body of this file. This is where our React application will be rendered.

### Example
Display a paragraph inside an element with the id of "root":
```js
ReactDOM.render(<p>Hello</p>, document.getElementById('root'));
```

The result is displayed in the `<div id="root">` element:

<body>
  <div id="root"></div>
</body>


## The HTML Code
The HTML code in this tutorial uses JSX which allows you to write HTML tags inside the JavaScript code:

Do not worry if the syntax is unfamiliar, you will learn more about JSX in the next chapter.

### Example
Create a variable that contains HTML code and display it in the "root" node:

```js
const myelement = (
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>John</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Elsa</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
);

ReactDOM.render(myelement, document.getElementById('root'));
```

## The Root Node
The root node is the HTML element where you want to display the result.

It is like a container for content managed by React.

It does NOT have to be a `<div>` element, and it does NOT have to have the id='root':

### Example
The root node can be called whatever you like:
```html
<body>
  <header id="sandy"></header>
</body>
```
Display the result in the `<header id="sandy">` element:
```js
ReactDOM.render(
    <p>Hallo</p>, 
    document.getElementById('sandy')
);
```

## Let's create a simple React app
To create a React project, you can use the command line:

```bash
npx create-2.-react-app my-app
```
Then move to the folder:

```bash
cd my-app
```

And to start the app, run the command:

```bash
npm start
```

Now click on this link http://localhost:3000/. You should see a simple React app. 

Open project in IDE. I am opening it in VS Code. You'll see these folders and files
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27571455/182032926-fbd80018-5ef8-4636-bf22-7395cb4df744.png)

In the folder "src", there is a file called "index.js". This is the file from where project starts. You see by default there's a component called "App", that is the root component of the app. In index.js, app.js is imported and then the app is rendered.

### src/index.js
```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';
import reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);

// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function
// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))
// or send to an analytics endpoint. Learn more: https://bit.ly/CRA-vitals
reportWebVitals();
```

### src/App.js
```js
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
        <p>
          Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
        </p>
        <a
          className="App-link"
          href="https://reactjs.org"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >
          Learn React
        </a>
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Now you do changes in the file "src/App.js" and save it. You'll see the changes reflected in the browser. If you are on this blog that means you do have knowledge about HTML, CSS, and javascript. Now you do some changes, change the text, add more tags, and save it. You'll see the changes reflected in the browser.

Play with the code and see how it works.

In coming docs, you will learn how to use the React library to build a web application.
