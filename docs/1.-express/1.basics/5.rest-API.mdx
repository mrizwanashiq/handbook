REST APIs are an industry-standard way for web services to send and receive data. They use HTTP request methods to facilitate the request-response cycle and typically transfer data using JSON, and more rarely - HTML, XML, and other formats.

APIs' (AKA backend) major role is to maintain the database and sometimes a bit of data processing before doing DB operation, its frontend sends requests to the backend if it needs to get, save, update, or delete any data. The question that may come into your mind is, can the frontend communicate with the database? If yes then it doesn't? Why are we maintaining a separate codebase (project) just to deal with the database?

For example, you are using Reactjs (or any other frontend framework). _**Everything the front end does is publicly visible (you can see in the browser's inspect `ctrl + shift + c`) and therefore insecure**_. Simply, if your database is manipulating data on the client side instead of the server side, then you're looking at a non-secure database. This makes your application prone to hacks and security issues. You do not want open your database port to public access. That's a big security risk. That's why you cannot communicate with a database from the front end, and you need the back end. if you use a frontend database like firebase, you do not need a backend at all. Classic web applications do not do that, they fetch the data from the backend and use a database in the backend

## HTTP Request Types
There are a few types of HTTP methods that we need to grasp before building a REST API. These are the methods that correspond to the CRUD tasks:

* POST: Used to submit data, typically used to create new entities.
* GET: Used to request data from the server, typically used to read data.
* PUT: Used to completely replace the resource with the submitted resource, typically used to update data.
* PATCH: Used to update the resource with the submitted resource, typically used to update data.
* DELETE: Used to delete an entity from the server.
