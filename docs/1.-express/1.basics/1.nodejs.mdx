## Introduction

NodeJS has been one of the biggest game-changer since its release. Javascript was always a client-side language until node.js. Common server-side languages include PHP, Python, Perl, Ruby, and several more. Node enables you to use the Javascript server side. This now means you can have consistent language on both ends which could not be done prior to Node.

NodeJS is a Server-side JavaScript runtime environment built on Google's Chrome V8 JavaScript engine. It compiles the JavaScript code into the native machine code and provides higher efficiency for the application. It's a cross-platform runtime environment that provides an event-driven, non-blocking input-output system. This feature makes it the best suitable for building fast, highly reliable, and scalable network or web applications as well as data-intensive real-time applications. 

NodeJS provides good throughput and higher consistency and that's why it is heavily used by companies for building large scalable single-page applications, video streaming applications, and web applications.

Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside a browser. You need to remember that NodeJS is neither a framework nor a programming language. Most people are confused and understand it's a framework or a programming language. We often use Node.js for building back-end services like APIs like Web App or Mobile App. It's used in production by large companies such as Paypal, Uber, Netflix, Walmart, and so on.

## Features:
There are other programming languages also that we can use to build back-end services so what makes Node.js different I am going to explain.
1. It's easy to get started and can be used for prototyping and agile development
2. It provides fast and highly scalable services
3. It uses JavaScript everywhere, so it's easy for a JavaScript programmer to build back-end services using Node.js
4. Source code cleaner and consistent.
5. Large ecosystem for open source library.
6. It has Asynchronous or Non-blocking nature.

## Advantages:
Here are the benefits of using Node.js 
1. **Easy Scalability:** Developers prefer to use Node.js because it is easily scaling the application in both horizontal and vertical directions. We can also add extra resources during the scalability of the application.
2. **Real-time web apps:** If you are building a web app you can also use PHP, and it will take the same amount of time when you use Node.js, But if I am talking about building chat apps or gaming apps Node.js is much more preferable because of faster synchronization. Also, the event loop avoids HTTP overloaded for Node.js development.
3. **Fast Suite:** NodeJs runs on the V8 engine developed by Google. The event loop in NodeJs handles all asynchronous operations so NodeJs acts like a fast suite and all the operations can be done quickly like reading or writing in the database, network connection, or file system
4. **Easy to learn and code:** NodeJs is easy to learn and code because it uses JavaScript. If you are a front-end developer and have a good grasp of JavaScript you can easily learn and build the application on NodeJS
5. **Advantage of Caching:** It provides the caching of a single module. Whenever there is any request for the first module, it gets cached in the application memory, so you don't need to re-execute the code.
6. **Data Streaming:** In NodeJs HTTP requests and responses are considered two separate events. They are data streams so when you process a file at the time of loading it will reduce the overall time and will make it faster when the data is presented in the form of transmissions. It also allows you to stream audio and video files at lightning speed.
7. **Hosting:** PaaS (Platform as a Service) and Heroku are the hosting platforms for NodeJS application deployment which is easy to use without facing any issue.
8. **Corporate Support:** Most well-known companies like Walmart, PayPal, Microsoft, and Yahoo are using NodeJS for building their applications. NodeJS uses JavaScript, so most companies are combining front-end and backend Teams together into a single unit.

## Application:
NodeJS should be preferred to build:
* Real-Time Chats,
* Complex Single-Page applications,
* Real-time collaboration tools,
* Streaming apps
* JSON APIs-based application
## History and Release
Released in 2009 and the first version of NPM is created. It was introduced by Ryan Dahl. 
* In 2010 Express and socket.io are introduced.
* In 2011 LinkedIn, Uber, and many big companies start using NodeJS.
* In 2016 Yarn was introduced along with Node.js 6
* The latest LTS Version of NodeJS is 12.18.3.


Let's move on to the next blog. Where I will talk about prerequisites for Express.js. So, that you know what you need to know before you start learning Express.js.
