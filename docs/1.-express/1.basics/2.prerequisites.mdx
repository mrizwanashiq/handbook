I assume that you have some basic understanding of the following topics. If you don't yet, try to learn before you start or you can do both parallel, it's up to you. But don't skip these topics and don't spend too much time on these.

## [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/)

If you are a frontend developer looking to master some backend skills then you don't have to spend a huge amount of time learning JavaScript before getting started with building Node.js applications. But in case you are a complete beginner who's looking to master Node.js in the minimum possible time then you must learn the following concepts before you deep dive into the Node.js environment.
* [Arrow Functions](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrow_function.asp)
* [Types](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_datatypes.asp)
* [Expressions](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_expressions.asp)
* [Functions](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp)
* [Lexical Structures](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_let.asp)
* [this](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_this.asp)
* [Loops and Scope](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for.asp)
* [Arrays](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp)
* [Template Literals](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_template_literals.asp)
* [Strict Mode](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_strict.asp)
* [ES6/ES7](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es6.asp)

## Asynchronous JavaScript
In NodeJS (ExpressJS) you will be handling a lot of asynchronous programming and for that, the following concepts are recommended to learn:
* [Timers](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_timing.asp)
* [Promises](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_promise.asp)
* [Closures](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_function_closures.asp)
* [The Event Loop](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_timing.asp)
* [Async programming and callbacks](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_async.asp)

> ### Asynchronous programming:
> Here the flow of execution is broken up into a series of steps, each of which is performed asynchronously with respect to the other steps. 

> If you want to learn more about asynchronicity, then you can read the following articles.
> * [Async/Await](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_async.asp)
> * [Callbacks](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_callback.asp)
> * [Promises](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_promises.asp)
> * [Timers](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_timers.asp)
> * [Closures](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_closures.asp)
> * [The Event Loop](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_event_loop.asp)
> * [Async programming and callbacks](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_async_callback.asp)

## [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/)

Node Package Manager is the world's largest Software Registry with over 800,000 code packages. Using NPM the right way can help a lot as managing packages becomes pretty handy with NPM while we develop applications that require a number of dependencies.

NPM consists of three distinct components:
* **The Command Line Interface (CLI):** It runs in the machine's terminal environment and how most of the developers interact with NPM
* **The Registry:** A large public database of JavaScript software and meta-information.
* **[The Website](https://npmjs.com):** You can discover new packages, and manage other aspects of your npm experience.

NPM is used for managing multiple versions of code and code dependencies, running packages without downloading them (using npx), and many more.

## [Node.js Basics](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/)

* **Event Emitters:** They are objects in Node.js that trigger events by sending a message to signal that an action was completed. We can also write our own code that listens to events from an event emitter. For example, if you have done some frontend work, then you probably know how much interaction we need to handle in our applications, such as mouse clicks, keyboard button presses, and other mouse movements. Similarly, on the backend environment in Node.js, we can build a similar system using the events' module, which offers EventEmitter class which we use to handle our events.

* **Callbacks:** These are functions called when a task is completed, which prevents any kind of blocking while allowing the rest of the code to run in the meantime. As we have to work with a lot of asynchronous tasks in Node.js, we need them everywhere for making seamless and faster applications. For example,

* **Buffers:** A class called Buffer in Node.js is designed to handle raw binary data. They correspond to some raw memory allocated outside V8. Buffers are an array of integers that can't be resized having a bunch of methods specifically for binary data. For example, the integers in buffer represent a byte with limited values from 0 to 255 inclusive, if you console.log() to print a Buffer instance, a chain of values in hexadecimal will be received.

* **Module System:** As a part of the Node.js ecosystem you will be using the Module for implementing complex functionality by just using the Modules provided by Node.js, these are JavaScript files that contain all the organized and complex features that anyone can reuse through the Node.js application.

## NodeJS Architecture
* Based on the single-threaded event loop model architecture which means client requests will be executed by a single thread in NodeJS.
* The event-driven nature of NodeJS allows you to handle multiple client requests concurrently.


## General Development Skills
* Learn GIT, create a few repositories on GitHub, and share your code with other people. As part of this series. I also wrote a blog about how to use GIT.
* Know HTTP(S) protocol, and request methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS). In this series, I added a blog about it.
    * GET: Used to retrieve a representation of a resource
    * POST: Used to create new resources
    * PUT: Used to replace capabilities
    * PATCH: Used to update capabilities
    * DELETE: Used to delete a resource identified by a URL
    * OPTIONS: Request permitted communication option for a given URL or server
* Don't be afraid of using Google, [Power Searching with Google](http://www.powersearchingwithgoogle.com/)
* Read a few books and docs about data structures and algorithms (DSA)
* [Clean code](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_conventions.asp)
* Terminal Usage
* Design Patterns
